## 🍌 STAPLES (Básicos)

### 1. BANANA

- **Selection:** No green at stem (unless for cooking). Small brown "sugar spots" indicate peak sweetness.
- **Technique A (Fresh): Brûlée.**
  - Slice lengthwise. Sprinkle sugar. Torch until glassy crack. Warm, custardy interior.

  - Freeze ripe slices. Blend in food processor. The pectin content makes it creamy like soft-serve without adding dairy.
- **Technique C (Waste): Peel Bacon.**
  - Marinate peels in soy/smoke. Pan fry. Vegan umami snack (popular in zero-waste kitchens).

### 2. MANZANA (Apple - Red/Green)

- **Selection:** Hard as a rock. If it yields to pressure, it's mealy.

  - Vacuum seal slices with elderflower syrup. The pressure breaks cell walls, making it translucent and dense like juicy glass.

- **Technique B (Texture): Crisp/Chip.**
  - Mandoline thin slices through the core (star pattern). Dehydrate. Beautiful edible garnish.
